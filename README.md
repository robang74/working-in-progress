## Working in progress

Working in progress and other stuff that I prefer to share here to give them a chance someone notice.

### Index

* **Chaos Shell Engine** documentation: 1. [presentation](chaos-shell-engine.md), &nbsp; 2. [lab notes](random.txt) &nbsp; 3. [thesys on jitters](2007-07-30-Tesi_Foglietta-051a.pdf)
* **Micro Chaos Engine** documentation: 1. [presentation](uchaos-vs-jitterentropy.md), &nbsp; 2. [uchaos.c](prpr/uchaos.c), 3. [vs jitterentropy](uchaos-vs-jitterentropy-grok.txt) w/Grok

Because exceptions, do not need to be common but just exist. In particular, about Chaos Shell Engine:

* [Novelties and Possibly mistakes](https://chatgpt.com/share/69886a46-5d0c-8012-a863-0094dca59e83) or [here](chaos-shell-engine-02.txt), but why do not investigate a bit deeper? Outside where AIs cannot go.
* New Proofs for NMAC and HMAC: [Security without Collision-Resistance](https://eprint.iacr.org/2006/043.pdf) or [here](pdf/security-without-collision-resistance-2006-043.pdf) by Mihir Bellare, April 2014.

And sometime, an image is worth thousands of words...
